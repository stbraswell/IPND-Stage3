TITLE: Structured Data: Definitions
DESCRIPTION: defs
NOTE: Class - A neatly packaged box that puts things together really well. A class is like a blueprint of a building - it can be used to build multiple buildings. A user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes that characterize any object of the class. The attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods, accessed via dot notation.
NOTE: Instance/Object - A unique instance of a data structure that's defined by its class. An object comprises both data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods. An individual object of a certain class. An object obj that belongs to a class Circle, for example, is an instance of the class Circle.
NOTE: Constructor - When an instance is created, the classes constructor is called (__init__)
NOTE: Self - Used in the constructor, self is the instance
NOTE: Instance Variable - A variable associated with a specific instance
NOTE: Instance Method - A function defined in a class and associated with an instance.

TITLE: Things to know about Python
DESCRIPTION: This section includes some random notes about python
NOTE: Classes are defined in a file.  For instance turtle.Turtle(), calls the class “Turtle”, which is located in the file “turtle”
NOTE: Python has a standard library which is very extensive, offering a wide range of facilities. The library contains built-in modules (written in C) that provide access to system functionality such as file I/O that would otherwise be inaccessible to Python programmers, as well as modules written in Python that provide standardized solutions for many problems that occur in everyday programming.
NOTE: There are many external libraries that provide additional modules, some can be found on the python website.
